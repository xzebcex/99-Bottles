# 99 Bottles
The lyrics of the song "99 Bottles of Milk" are shown in the terminal by this Python application.

## Description
The "99 Bottles" code is a straightforward Python script that shows the lyrics of the popular song "99 Bottles of Beer" on the console. The application begins by publishing the song's title and a message noting that the user can exit by pressing Ctrl-C. The software then enters a loop that repeats the song's lines, beginning with 99 bottles of milk on the wall and counting down to one bottle of milk. The loop stops for a predetermined period of time between each verse so that the user can follow along with the words. When the loop reaches the final verse, the software outputs the song's final stanza and exits.
